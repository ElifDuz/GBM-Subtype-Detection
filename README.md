This file contains the code for subdividing a dataset normalized using the GSVA package into molecular subtypes. 
The GBM subtypes are based on the Verhaak study, which classifies tumors into three main subtypes. 
Paired samples were used, and the data were stratified according to their respective subtypes.
A paired differential expression analysis (DEG) was conducted specifically on samples that retained the same subtype between the primary and recurrent groups.
Up and dpwnregulated genes were detected based on the subtypes.
